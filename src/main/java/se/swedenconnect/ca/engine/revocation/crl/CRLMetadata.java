 * cooperates to provide a unified revocation experience where these data are synchronized and
 * shared among the instances.
 *
 * The data provided here reflects the latest CRL update made by any instance and allows

 * of a new CRL and thus also update and share an updated version of this metadata, allowing
 * other instances to follow.
